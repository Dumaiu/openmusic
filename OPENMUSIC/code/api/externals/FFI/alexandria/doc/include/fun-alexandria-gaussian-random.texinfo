@deffn {Function} {gaussian-random} @&optional min max
@findex gaussian-random
Returns two gaussian random double floats as the primary and secondary value,
optionally constrained by @code{min} and @code{max}. Gaussian random numbers form a standard
normal distribution around @code{0}.0d0.

Sufficiently positive @code{min} or negative @code{max} will cause the algorithm used to
take a very long time. If @code{min} is positive it should be close to zero, and
similarly if @code{max} is negative it should be close to zero.
