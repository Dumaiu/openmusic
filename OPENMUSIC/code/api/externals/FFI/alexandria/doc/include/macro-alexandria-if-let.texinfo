@anchor{Macro if-let}
@deffn {Macro} {if-let} bindings @&body (then-form &optional else-form)
@findex if-let
Creates new variable bindings, and conditionally executes either
@code{then-form} or @code{else-form}. @code{else-form} defaults to @code{nil}.

@code{bindings} must be either single binding of the form:

@lisp
 (variable initial-form)
@end lisp

or a list of bindings of the form:

@lisp
 ((variable-1 initial-form-1)
  (variable-2 initial-form-2)
  ...
  (variable-n initial-form-n))
@end lisp

All initial-forms are executed sequentially in the specified order. Then all
the variables are bound to the corresponding values.

If all variables were bound to true values, the @code{then-form} is executed with the
bindings in effect, otherwise the @code{else-form} is executed with the bindings in
effect.
@end deffn
