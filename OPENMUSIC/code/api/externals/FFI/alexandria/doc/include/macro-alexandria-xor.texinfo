@findex xor
Evaluates its arguments one at a time, from left to right. If more then one
argument evaluates to a true value no further @code{datums} are evaluated, and @code{nil} is
returned as both primary and secondary value. If exactly one argument
evaluates to true, its value is returned as the primary value after all the
arguments have been evaluated, and @code{t} is returned as the secondary value. If no
arguments evaluate to true @code{nil} is retuned as primary, and @code{t} as secondary
value.
