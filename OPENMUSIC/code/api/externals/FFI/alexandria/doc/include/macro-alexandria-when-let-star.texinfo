@anchor{Macro when-let*}
@deffn {Macro} {when-let*} bindings @&body forms
@findex when-let*
Creates new variable bindings, and conditionally executes @code{forms}.

@code{bindings} must be either single binding of the form:

@lisp
 (variable initial-form)
@end lisp

or a list of bindings of the form:

@lisp
 ((variable-1 initial-form-1)
  (variable-2 initial-form-2)
  ...
  (variable-n initial-form-n))
@end lisp

Each initial-form is executed in turn, and the variable bound to the
corresponding value. Initial-form expressions can refer to variables
previously bound by the @code{when-let*}.

Execution of @code{when-let*} stops immediately if any initial-form evaluates to @code{nil}.
If all initial-forms evaluate to true, then @code{forms} are executed as an implicit
@code{progn}.
@end deffn
