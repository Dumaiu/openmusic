@findex define-constant
Ensures that the global variable named by @code{name} is a constant with a value
that is equal under @code{test} to the result of evaluating @code{initial-value}. @code{test} is a
/function designator/ that defaults to @code{eql}. If @code{documentation} is given, it
becomes the documentation string of the constant.

Signals an error if @code{name} is already a bound non-constant variable.

Signals an error if @code{name} is already a constant variable whose value is not
equal under @code{test} to result of evaluating @code{initial-value}.
