@anchor{Macro with-gensyms}
@deffn {Macro} {with-gensyms} names @&body forms
@findex with-gensyms
Binds each variable named by a symbol in @code{names} to a unique symbol around
@code{forms}. Each of @code{names} must either be either a symbol, or of the form:

@lisp
 (symbol string-designator)
@end lisp

Bare symbols appearing in @code{names} are equivalent to:

@lisp
 (symbol symbol)
@end lisp

The string-designator is used as the argument to @code{gensym} when constructing the
unique symbol the named variable will be bound to.
@end deffn
