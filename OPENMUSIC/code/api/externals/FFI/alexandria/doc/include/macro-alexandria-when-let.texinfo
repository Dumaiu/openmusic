@anchor{Macro when-let}
@deffn {Macro} {when-let} bindings @&body forms
@findex when-let
Creates new variable bindings, and conditionally executes @code{forms}.

@code{bindings} must be either single binding of the form:

@lisp
 (variable initial-form)
@end lisp

or a list of bindings of the form:

@lisp
 ((variable-1 initial-form-1)
  (variable-2 initial-form-2)
  ...
  (variable-n initial-form-n))
@end lisp

All initial-forms are executed sequentially in the specified order. Then all
the variables are bound to the corresponding values.

If all variables were bound to true values, then @code{forms} are executed as an
implicit @code{progn}.
@end deffn
