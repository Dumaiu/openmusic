@findex copy-hash-table
Returns a copy of hash table @code{table}, with the same keys and values
as the @code{table}. The copy has the same properties as the original, unless
overridden by the keyword arguments.

Before each of the original values is set into the new hash-table, @code{key}
is invoked on the value. As @code{key} defaults to @code{cl:identity}, a shallow
copy is returned by default.
