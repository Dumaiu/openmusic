@deffn {Function} {standard-deviation} sample @&key biased
@findex standard-deviation
Standard deviation of @code{sample}. Returns the biased standard deviation if
@code{biased} is true (the default), and the square root of the unbiased estimator
for variance if @code{biased} is false (which is not the same as the unbiased
estimator for standard deviation). @code{sample} must be a sequence of numbers.
