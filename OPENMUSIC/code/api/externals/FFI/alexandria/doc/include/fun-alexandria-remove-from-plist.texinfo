@deffn {Function} {remove-from-plist} plist @&rest keys
@findex remove-from-plist
Returns a propery-list with same keys and values as @code{plist}, except that keys
in the list designated by @code{keys} and values corresponding to them are removed.
The returned property-list may share structure with the @code{plist}, but @code{plist} is
not destructively modified. Keys are compared using @code{eq}.
