;------------------------------------
; RELEASE NOTES:
;------------------------------------
Since OM 6.13 the distribution package is modified to conform with macOS security changes
No more ressources are accessed with relative pathnames outside the .app bundle

1) Libraries are all stored in a separate folder and distributed as separate packages.
The default location is (USER_HOME)/OM/Libraries/
Other locations can be added in the Preferences (as is previous versions)
2) The 'patches' folder is no more visible: you can find it as OM 6.x.app/Contents/Init,
or simply put your Lisp code in the Workspace's "user" folder instead.
3) The OM source code is still accessible from OM, but also now relocated 
inside the .app bundle's resources.

;------------------------------------
; If you want to load and use OM code in LispWorks, 
; check/download the source package from the repository: 
; https://forge.ircam.fr/p/OM/ 
; 
; ...or clone it using GIT:
; $ git clone git://git.forge.ircam.fr/OM.git

* RELEASE NOTES 6.16

  - The precompiled version of OMAudioLib.so included with the
    released version of OM6.16 is now installed and looked up from
    inside OMs resources folder.

    This version of the dynamic library is compiled with GLIBC v.2.27,
    to try to stay compatible with previous and current versions of
    OS'es, and adding "-Wl,--as-needed" to JUCE_LDFLAGS, to not demand
    sometimes conflicting dependencies such as libcurl/libcurl-gnutls,
    which are never needed by OM anyhow.

    The aim is to provide a minimal binary which will run on all
    current 64-bit versions of Linux - Redhat based (Fedora) or Debian
    based (Ubuntu).

    If for some reason you need to compile your own OMAudioLib.so,
    instructions are found together with the sources:

      https://github.com/openmusic-project/omaudiolib

  - various installation names now try to recognize '6' (as in
    'openmusic6', 'om6logo.png') etc. - to allow different versions of
    OM to be installed alongside each other

* RELEASE NOTES 6.14.2

  - many bug fixes and improvements, check the git sources and logs for detail
